# Tools and Materials
Soldering iron with a smaller tip, Hakko
Breadboard, for holding headers while soldering them to the board
Solder, what diameter?
Jumper wires

# Parts
* Base Station (RX)
    * [Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi - ATSAMD21 + ATWINC1500](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3010)
    * [Adafruit LoRa Radio FeatherWing - RFM95W 900 MHz - RadioFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3231)
* Sensor (TX)
    * [Adafruit Feather M0 with RFM95 LoRa Radio - 900MHz - RadioFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178)
    * [Simple Spring Antenna - 915MHz](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4269)
    * [Platinum RTD Sensor - PT1000 - 3 Wire 1 meter long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3984)
    * [Adafruit PT1000 RTD Temperature Sensor Amplifier - MAX31865](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3328)
    * [Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor - I2C Capacitive Moisture Sensor - JST PH 2mm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026)
        * Note: These seem unreliable, and drain the battery. Testing [Chirp!](https://www.tindie.com/products/miceuz/i2c-soil-moisture-sensor/) sensors next.
* LiPo batteries
    * [Lithium Ion Cylindrical Battery - 3.7v 2200mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1781)
    * [Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 500mAh Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 500mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578)
* Stainless steel tube for temperature probe
    * Aliexpress Seiko Metal Store
    * Length 500mm x 1Pcs, OD5mm X ID4.2mm, feels a little too easy to bend. Easy fit in tube, might allow more epoxy for a stronger bond.
    * Length 500mm x 1Pcs, OD5mm X ID4mm, feels stiffer. Need to trim blob of epoxy of on PT1000D for it to fit in.
    * Another 150-250mm in length would be nice.
    * Be careful buying elsewhere, tolerances on eBay stuff is junk.

# build

## base station (RX)
solder headers and connectors onto the boards
solder the spring antenna 

## sensor (TX)
solder the headers and connectors onto the boards
solder the spring antenna
insert the thermcouple into the stainless steel tube
